Shadow Child,common,potion,41,,"You are filled with intense feelings of confusion before an apparition emerges from your body that resembles a young girl with onyx skin and hair and piercing green eyes. Only you can see it, and it can't speak. It functions as the Unseen Servant spell and lasts for 1 hour.25"
Candy Xorn,common,wondrous item,56,,"Candy xorn is a round, waxy candy that typically comes in small bags of 2d6 + 3 pieces. Each piece is traditionally either orange or yellow, but always has a narrow, reptilian pupil drawn at its center. Eating a candy xorn causes your eyes to turn orange or yellow (your choice), and your pupils to match the ones found on the piece of candy. After 1 minute, the effect ends and your eyes return to normal.In addition, each piece of candy xorn has a 5 percent chance to not be candy at all, but actually a gemstone covered in the sugared coating. When you find a gemstone in this way, it can be either eye agate (40%, 10 gp), tiger's eye (40%, 10 gp), or amber (20%, 100 gp)."
Phantom Walkers,uncommon,wondrous item,319,,"While wearing these boots, the DC of any ability checks made to track your movements using your footprints increases by 5.In addition, you can use a bonus action to cause the boots to leave behind no footprints for 1 minute. When you do, another set of similar footprints appear on the ground that lead in random directions. These footprints last for 8 hours and travel up to 300 feet. A successful DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the footprints are magical. Once this property of the boots has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn."

Fists of the Guiding Star,uncommon,wondrous item,245,requires attunement by a monk,"Stars and celestial bodies glimmer through these hand wrappings. While wearing these wraps over your hands, you can use a bonus action to spend 1 ki point to cause small motes of starlight to guide a creature you can see within 30 feet of you, giving it advantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of your next turn. If that creature's next attack hits, the attack deals extra radiant damage equal to your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).In addition, you can use an action to cast the light cantrip while wearing these wraps."
Gruul Keyrune,rare,wondrous item,946,requires attunement by a member of the Gruul guild,"This crude keyrune is cobbled together from bits of rubble, broken glass, bone, and animal hair. One end resembles a horned beast. On command, the keyrune transforms into a ceratok, a horned creature much like a rhinoceros (and with the same statistics). It remains in its ceratok form for 1 hour.When you use an action to speak the item's command word and place the keyrune on the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into a ceratok. If there isn't enough space for the creature, the keyrune doesn't transform.The creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves to avoid danger.At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can't transform again until 36 hours have passed."
