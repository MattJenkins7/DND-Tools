"Accounting and Valuation of All Things","CoA","272","artifact","wondrous item","requires attunement","","","","","","The Accounting and Valuation of All Things is bound in gold leaf, with pages of silver and text of blood.This is a magic tome that functions as a spellbook and arcane focus. You have a +3 bonus to your spell attack and spell save DC. Random Properties. The Accounting and Valuation of All Things has the following random properties:1 major beneficial property1 major detrimental property The Soul Trade. One section of the book is dedicated to negotiating and valuing mortal souls. When the book is opened within 10 feet of a creature with a soul, that creature must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the tome analyzes their greatest desires and calculates exactly what they would need to give up their soul. That information is then displayed within the tome, such that the user can offer a trade to acquire a soul. Creatures that succeed on the saving throw simply show up as a question mark in the book's pages and are immune to further valuations. Mammon's Tax. When the Accounting and Valuation of All Things is used as a spellbook, it maintains a unique ability to forcibly acquire souls. Any creature killed by a spell transcribed within the book has their soul ripped from their body and sent to Minauros. This process renders the subject immune to all forms of resurrection aside from True Resurrection. In payment for their soul, Mammon drops gold equal to (20 × CR) or (2 × Level) on their corpse. Negotiation Tactics. The tome is capable of providing some assistance to all negotiations, not just those made for souls. You gain a passive +5 to Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to barter. Additionally, as an action, you can surrender your consciousness to the tome, allowing it to take over. For 1 minute, the Accounting and Valuation of All Things speaks for you, using a +12 Charisma (Persuasion) skill and gaining advantage on your rolls. Using the book in this manner has a corrupting influence, and each use compels you to become increasingly greedy, vain, and evil—much like its original owner, Mammon. When the duration ends, if your alignment is non-evil, you suffer 6d6 necrotic damage. Transcribed Spells. The spellbook section of the Accounting and Valuation of All Things comes with some spells already recorded. For each spell level, roll (1d4 - 1). The DM will determine the necessary spells of each level that already exist within the tome. If you copy spells from the tome to your own spellbook, the cost in gold is doubled. On the opposite end, copying spells from your spellbook to the tome only costs half the gold it normally would. Destroying the Tome. Destroying the Accounting and Valuation of All Things can be done in two ways. The first option is a simple bribe to Mammon to have him destroy the tome. An offering of 99,999 gp must be made, at midnight, by opening the book and placing the gold inside. If Mammon accepts the offering, the gold melts around the book, then both vanish.The second route, in case Mammon is unavailable or unwilling, is to incinerate the book. To accomplish this task, a pot of platinum (valued at no less than 99,999 gp) must be melted, enough to fully submerge the book. Once the platinum is prepared, dropping the tome into the molten solution melts the tome. The process completely destroys the tome, as well as the platinum."

Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that would be such a symbol.Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted four great tools: the Brutal Pick, the Earthheart Forge, the Anvil of Songs, and the Shaping Hammer. With them, he forged the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords.Armed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it. Magic Weapon. The Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a belt of dwarvenkind, a dwarven thrower, and a sword of sharpness. Random Properties. The axe has the following randomly determined properties:2 minor beneficial properties1 major beneficial property2 minor detrimental properties Blessings of Moradin. If you are a dwarf attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits:You have immunity to poison damage.The range of your darkvision increases by 60 feet.You gain proficiency with artisan's tools related to blacksmithing, brewing, and stonemasonry.

You can't use this property again until the next dawn. Travel the Depths. You can use an action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the teleport spell from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this property again until 3 days have passed. Curse. The axe bears a curse that affects any non-dwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature's physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes wrought by the axe aren't considered magical in nature (and therefore can't be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a greater restoration or remove curse spell. Destroying the Axe. The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed. Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property. Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack."

"Azuremite","TDCSR","141","unknown (magic)","illegal drug","","","","","","","The ruins of this sprawling city are now known as the Crystalfen Caverns. These caves are home to scattered veins of azuremite, a gorgeous blue crystal that formed from millennia of psychic energies existing near element deposits. Curious explorers who discovered the veins found that, when mined and refined into a fine dust, the azuremite powder is a strong mind-altering agent and induces temporary visions and other psychic phenomena.While a number of small, isolated entrances to this labyrinth of tunnels have been discovered and adventuring parties have attempted to chart the mines, the caverns are so vast and deep that either they gave up for fear of becoming lost, or they were assailed by the terrible denizens of the caverns, never to return. Most who now brave the caverns are foolish treasure hunters or criminals seeking to mine more azuremite to sell on the black market.This item is an illegal drug; see Illegal Drugs for more information."

"Baba Yaga's Mortar and Pestle","TCE","121","artifact","wondrous item","requires attunement","","","","","","The creations of the immortal hag Baba Yaga defy the laws of mortal magic. Among the notorious implements that cement her legend on countless worlds are the artifacts that propel her through the planes: Baba Yaga's Mortar and Pestle. These signature tools of Baba Yaga are a single artifact for purposes of attunement. Should the two objects become separated, the pestle appears next to the mortar at the next dawn. Random Properties. This artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the ""Artifacts"" section of the Dungeon Master's Guide:2 minor beneficial properties1 major beneficial property1 minor detrimental property Properties of the Mortar. The mortar is a Tiny wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in size to accommodate anything you place inside, expanding-if there's enough space-up to Large size, meaning it can hold even a Large creature. Properties of the Pestle. The pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra 1d8 force damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn. Perfect Tools. While holding the mortar and pestle, you can use your action to say the name of any nonmagical plant, mineral, or fluid and an amount of the material worth 10 gp or less. The mortar instantly fills with the desired amount of that material. Once you use this action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.You can also use the artifact as alchemist's supplies, brewer's supplies, cook's utensils, an herbalism kit, and a poisoner's kit. You have advantage on any check you make using the artifact as one of these tools. Primal Parts. As an action while the pestle and the mortar is within 5 feet of you, you can command the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you use your action to verbally command it to stop, the pestle moves on its own, grinding the contents of the mortar into a mush or fine powder that's equally useful for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in the mortar takes 4d10 force damage. If this reduces the target's hit points to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, as appropriate. Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can have the mortar separate its contents-like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped organs-into separate piles. Traverse the Night. If you are holding the pestle while you are inside the mortar, you can use your action to verbally command the mortar to travel to a specific place or creature.You don't need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific destination-not just the nearest river or a red dragon's lair. If the stated destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination. You arrive at the location 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later. Bones Know Their Home. When you command the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the dust or paste of something ground by the mortar and name a location on a different plane of existence or a different world on the Material Plane. If that material came from a creature native to the named plane or world, the mortar travels through an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that destination, arriving in 1 minute. Destroying the Mortar and Pestle. The mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed underfoot by the Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga or by Baba Yaga herself."

"Ball of Wild Earth","TGS2","41","common","wondrous item","","","","","","","This Tiny, sentient pebble is covered in dirt and is likely a remnant of a charmed earth elemental. It rolls about on its own in search of new and unique sources of dirt. When it finds a patch of particularly rich soil, the ball rolls around in it to incorporate the dirt into its form. The ball carries captured moisture inside itself, allowing it to make its form either dusty or clay-like in texture, as well as hard or soft to the touch. A friendly ball of wild earth can magically reshape the dirt it's covered in to form a variety of shapes at will, such as a tiny figurine or a large die, provided that the dirt continues to cover the pebble at its center by doing so.The ball of wild earth is considered a magical object and is not a creature.

Most can be found, at least initially, in mountainous farmlands, but even urban ones can enjoy the dust and traces of weird, foreign dirt that are ever-present in well-traveled cities. The quickest way to make a ball of wild earth happy is to give it gemstone dust to roll in, whereas removing the dirt and mud that surround its central pebble is certain to upset it. By reforming the dirt covering its form, the ball can make vague facial expressions based on the emotions its seen other creatures make."

A creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. On a failed save, a creature is charmed by you while it remains within the field. A charmed creature is indifferent about creatures it can see that it's hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell, or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. If you or your companions harm a charmed creature or its friends, the charm ends. When the charm or field ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise.When a creature makes an attack or casts a harmful spell that either affects a target within the field or enters or leaves the field's area, that creature must first make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw.

You can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action to cast dispel magic on a creature, an object, or a magical effect that you touch with the tip of the staff. If the target is an unwilling creature or an object in the possession of such a creature, you must hit the creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff before you can expend the charge to cast the spell. Drain Magic. This property affects only creatures that use spell slots. When you hit such a creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff, you can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action, causing the target to expend one spell slot of the highest spell level it can cast without casting a spell. If the target has already expended all its spell slots, nothing happens. Spell slots that are expended in this fashion are regained when the target finishes a long rest, as normal. Master of Enchantment. When you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher while holding the staff, you can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC of 10 + the level of the spell. If the check succeeds, you cast the spell without expending a spell slot. Sentience. The Blackstaff is a sentient staff of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature that is holding it. Personality. The staff has the spirits of all previous Blackstaffs trapped within it. Its creator, Khelben Arunsun, is the dominant personality among them. Like Khelben, the staff is extremely devious and manipulative. It prefers to counsel its owner without exerting outright control. The staff's primary goal is to protect Waterdeep and its Open Lord, currently Laeral Silverhand. Its secondary goal is to help its wielder become more powerful.In the event that the holder of the office of the Blackstaff no longer serves the staff's wishes, the staff ceases to function until it finds a worthy inheritor—someone whose loyalty to Waterdeep is beyond reproach. Spirit Trap. When the Blackstaff dies, the spirit of that individual becomes trapped in the staff along with the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs. (A Blackstaff whose spirit is trapped in the staff can't be raised from the dead.)Destroying the staff would release the spirits trapped inside it, but in that event, Khelben's spirit can lodge itself inside any one piece of the staff that remains. The piece containing Khelben's spirit has the staff's Sentience property but none of its other properties. As long as this piece of the staff exists, Khelben's spirit can make the staff whole again whenever he wishes. When the staff is remade, the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs become trapped inside it again. Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack."

The effect ends early if you release the spirit as a bonus action or if you're farther than 60 feet away from the spear for more than 1 minute.

As an action, you can point this sword at one devil you can see within 60 feet of you. That devil must succeed on a DC 22 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 hour. While charmed in this way, the devil follows your orders to the best of its ability.

Curse. This lantern is cursed, and attuning to it extends that curse to you. You remain cursed as long as you remain attuned to the lantern, which can only be ended with a wish spell or by the touch of a powerful fey creature. Even if you die, your attunement to the lantern doesn't end until 7 days have passed.As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the lantern, keeping it within reach at all times. In addition, you must continuously feed the lantern's flame using your own vitality. Whenever you gain or spend any number of Hit Dice, you must also sacrifice one Hit Die to the lantern (if you have any). Alternatively, you can use an action to open the lantern's door and hold your hand over the flame, sacrificing one of your Hit Dice when you do. If the lantern isn't given any Hit Dice for 24 hours, you die, and the flame goes out until the lantern is attuned to by another creature or you return to life while still attuned to it."

"Book of Vile Darkness (Variant)","KftGV","207","artifact","wondrous item","requires attunement","","","","5 lb.","","The contents of this foul manuscript of ineffable wickedness are the meat and drink of those in evil's thrall. No mortal was meant to know the secrets it contains, knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the scrawled pages invites madness.Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the Book of Vile Darkness. He recorded in its pages every diseased idea, every unhinged thought, and every example of blackest magic he came across or devised. Vecna covered every vile topic he could, making the book a gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs.Other practitioners of evil have held the book and added their own input to its catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases, made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages are missing, torn. or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that the original text can't be divined.Nature can't abide the book's presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough.A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and reap its benefits. The creature can then freely modify the book's contents, provided that those modifications advance evil and expand the lore already contained within.Whenever a non-evil creature attunes to the Book of Vile Darkness, that creature must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment changes to neutral evil.The Book of Vile Darkness remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can't be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned.The Book of Vile Darkness has the following properties:Circle of Death. While attuned to the book, you can cast circle of death (save DC 20) from it as an action. After you cast the spell, roll a d6. On a roll of 1-5, you can't use this property again until the next dawn.Condition Immunities. While attuned to the book, you can't be charmed or frightened.Evil Presence. The book houses an evil spirit that is hostile toward you. When you become attuned to the book, the spirit tries to leave the book and enter your body. If you fail a DC 20 Charisma saving throw, it succeeds, and you become an NPC under the DM's control until the intruding spirit is banished using magic such as the dispel evil and good spell. The banished spirit returns to the book. Adjusted Ability Scores. After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, one ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can't adjust your ability scores again. Mark of Darkness. After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign of your devotion to vile darkness. An evil rune might appear on your face, your eyes might become glossy black, or horns might sprout from your forehead. Or you might become wizened and hideous, lose all facial features, gain a forked tongue, or some other feature the DM chooses. The mark of darkness grants you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with evil creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with non-evil creatures. Command Evil. While you are attuned to the book and holding it, you can use an action to cast the dominate monster spell on an evil target (save DC 18). You can't use this property again until the next dawn. Dark Lore. You can reference the Book of Vile Darkness whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about demons. When you do so, double your proficiency bonus on that check. Dark Speech. While you carry the Book of Vile Darkness and are attuned to it, you can use an action to recite words from its pages in a foul language known as Dark Speech. Each time you do so, you take 1d12 psychic damage, and each non-evil creature within 15 feet of you takes 3d6 psychic damage. Destroying the Book. The Book of Vile Darkness allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome.If a solar tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for 1d100 years, after which it reforms in some dark corner of the multiverse.A creature attuned to the book for one hundred years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a blinding flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book reforms 1d10 × 100 years later.If all evil in the multiverse is wiped out, the book turns to dust and is forever destroyed."

The rehydrated cube moves slowly while animated in this way, methodically cleaning objects and surfaces it comes into contact with. The cube remains hydrated for up to 8 hours, but can be squeezed as an action (as if it were a sponge) to dehydrate it again early.The cleaning cube is considered a magical object and is not a creature. It has a speed of 1 foot and can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. It has AC 10, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. The cube dehydrates when it drops to 0 hit points, but regains all its hit points when hydrated again. Sentience.

Whether Constantori's actual appearance matches the painting remains a subject of debate. The portrait is one of several paintings commissioned by the late Daiyani Grysthorn, a crime lord who frequently gave magical paintings as gifts to her most esteemed associates. Sentience. Constantori's Portrait is a sentient, lawful evil item with an Intelligence score of 14, a Wisdom score of 12, and a Charisma score of 8. It can hear within a range of 120 feet and has darkvision within a range of 60 feet, but it can't see anything behind itself.The painting can converse in Common, Draconic, and Elvish as if it were a living person, though Constantori's mouth doesn't move. Whenever conversation occurs within the portrait's auditory range, the painting eagerly gathers secrets, the names of secret tellers, significant events, or any political conversations. Personality. Constantori's Portrait is demanding, condescending, and vain. It doesn't like being covered or placed out of sight, and it loudly condemns anyone who tries to remove it from its gold-leaf frame. Wealth of Information. The painting's primary purpose is to observe and recall conversations. Over the past few decades, Constantori's Portrait has quietly observed countless conversations and now possesses an unquantifiable amount of lore—everything from criminal conspiracies to secret passwords. The DM decides what the painting knows and what it doesn't.While attuned to the painting, you can take an action to telepathically contact it over any distance, provided you and the painting are on the same plane of existence.

While you are attuned to the painting, you can command it to guard its location against one or more creatures you identify as the painting's enemies. The painting performs this function until you command it to stop or until your attunement to the painting ends.The painting has 3 charges. When a creature the painting identifies as its enemy starts its turn in a space the painting can see, the painting expends 1 of its charges to cast magic missile (3 missiles), targeting that creature. The painting regains all expended charges daily at dawn.The painting is a Small object with AC 12, 20 hit points, and immunity to poison damage. In its gold-leaf frame, the painting weighs 15 pounds. If the painting has at least 1 hit point and is targeted by a mending spell, it regains 2d6 hit points."

"Cottage Chest","TGS2","65","rare","wondrous item","","","","","","","This 1-foot-long chest looks like a replica of a woodland cottage and is magically locked. You can use an action to place this chest on the ground and speak its command word. The chest immediately unlocks and grows into a cottage that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the cottage is empty. When dismissed, the cottage returns to its normal chest form. If there isn't enough space for the cottage or there are creatures in its area when you speak the command word, the chest remains locked and the action is wasted.The cottage is a wooden, two-story building that's 40 feet wide and 65 feet long. Inside is a kitchen, a dining room, and a large parlor with an ever-burning fire in its hearth. A curling stairway leads to the second floor, which has 4 bedrooms equipped with furniture you'd find in a modest to respectable inn. The first floor has six windows, and each bedroom on the second floor has one. When activated, the cottage has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime of opening.The cottage's kitchen is filled with magical utensils that automatically stir, measure, and heat all manner of cuisine. Any check made using cook's utensils within the cottage has advantage on the roll. When left to its own devices, the cottage magically produces an array of baked goods for up to 8 creatures when the cottage appears for the first time each day and again each day at dawn until it is dismissed. Eating the food within the cottage provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day. If any baked goods are left uneaten, they vanish at dawn as the new goods appear. Any baked good, furniture, or similar object vanishes when taken outside the cottage and immediately reappears inside.Further, fey and fiends can't enter the cottage unless you choose to let them, and creatures can't move or travel into it using teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar means.The cottage is made of wood and plaster, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over or moved. The roof, the door, and the walls (including the windows) each have 60 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a wish spell can repair the cottage (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain all its hit points."

"Crook of Rao","TCE","123","artifact","wondrous item","requires attunement","","","","","","Ages ago, the serene god Rao created a tool to shield his fledgling faithful against the evils of the Lower Planes. Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the Crook of Rao was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact's bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the Crook of Rao -potentially for the final time. Random Properties. The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the ""Artifacts"" section of the Dungeon Master's Guide:2 minor beneficial properties1 major beneficial property1 minor detrimental property Spells. The crook has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: aura of life (2 charges), aura of purity (2 charges), banishment (1 charge), beacon of hope (1 charge), mass cure wounds (3 charges). The crook regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. Absolute Banishment. While you are attuned to the crook and holding it, you can spend 10 minutes to banish all but the mightiest fiends within 1 mile of you. Any fiend with a challenge rating of 19 or higher is unaffected. Each banished fiend is sent back to its home plane and can't return to the plane the Crook of Rao banished it from for 100 years. Failing Matrix. Whenever the Crook of Rao's Absolute Banishment property is used, or when its last charge is expended, roll on the Extraplanar Reversal table. Any creatures conjured as a result of this effect appear in random unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are not under your control. Iggwilv's Curse. When the Crook was last used against Iggwilv, the Witch Queen lashed out at the artifact, infecting its magical matrix. Over the years, this curse has spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the Crook of Rao, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent gate spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend's name in Iggwilv's voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the Crook of Rao. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.Extraplanar Reversald100Effect1-25A portal to a random plane opens. The portal closes after 5 minutes.26-452d4 imps and 2d4 quasits appear.46-601d8 succubi/incubi appear.61-701d10 barbed devils and 1d10 vrocks appear.71-801 arcanaloth, 1 night hag, and 1 rakshasa appear.81-851 ice devil and 1 marilith appear.86-901 balor and 1 pit fiend appear. At the DM's discretion, a portal opens into the presence of an archdevil or demon lord instead, then closes after 5 minutes.91-00Iggwilv's Curse (see the Iggwilv's Curse property). Destroying or Repairing the Crook. The Crook of Rao can either be destroyed or repaired by journeying to Mount Celestia and obtaining a tear from the eternally serene god Rao. One way to make the emotionless god cry would be to reunite Rao with the spirit of his first worshiper who sought revelations beyond the multiverse long ago. The Crook dissolves if immersed in the god's tear for a year and a day. If washed in the tear daily for 30 days, the Crook loses its Failing Matrix property."

While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to make a blade of pure radiance spring from the hilt, or cause the blade to disappear. While the blade exists, this magic longsword has the finesse property.

It knows every language you know while attuned to it. Personality. Forged by ancient sun worshippers, Dawnbringer is meant to bring light into darkness and to fight creatures of darkness. It is kind and compassionate to those in need, but fierce and destructive to its enemies.Long years lost in darkness have made Dawnbringer frightened of both the dark and abandonment. It prefers that its blade always be present and shedding light in areas of darkness, and it strongly resists being parted from its wielder for any length of time. Finesse.

"Death's Shadow","TGS2","69","legendary","wondrous item","requires attunement","","","","","","This black garnet amulet is carved into the shape of a bird's skull and is adorned with several dark feathers. At its center is a single phoenix feather that serves as a catalyst for this strange talisman's necromantic magic. While wearing this amulet, you are immune to necrotic damage. Shadow Form. When you are reduced to 0 hit points while wearing this amulet, a shadowy version of yourself rises from your unconscious body. You control this form, which has your equipment and statistics. It has 100 temporary hit points and resistance to all damage that isn't force, psychic, or radiant. The shadow form can't move more than 60 feet from your body. The shadow vanishes after 1 minute or when it loses all its temporary hit points. If the shadow survives for the duration, it returns to your body and causes you to regain a number of hit points equal to the shadow's remaining number of temporary hit points. If the shadow is defeated, the amulet is destroyed and you immediately fail 2 death saving throws.While your shadow form is defending you, your unconscious body is covered by an impenetrable veil of shadow.

If you die while the watch is on your person, the watch reverses your personal time stream just long enough to keep you alive, returning you to life with 1 hit point and allowing you to immediately stand up. When the watch reverses time in this way, one of the watch's three glass panes cracks and can't be repaired by mundane or magical means. For each pane of cracked glass, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance that the watch fails to reverse time when you die. When all three panes of glass are cracked, the watch becomes nonmagical, although it can still be used to tell the time."

While cursed, your creature type becomes undead, in addition to your other existing creature types.A creature remains cursed in this way until targeted by a wish spell or divine intervention. Removing the crown fails to end the curse. While a cursed creature may not reveal that the diadem is cursed, its allies may be able to deduce its presence and effects based on the creature's behavior."

"Deck of Many More Things","BMT","51","legendary","wondrous item","","","","","","","Over the centuries since the first Deck of Many Things was created, many have sought and failed to replicate it. But some have created new cards. These forty-four additional cards are known collectively as the Deck of Many More Things. (More information on creating new cards for this deck appears in chapter 2.)Like the Deck of Many Things, the Deck of Many More Things manifests differently on various worlds. While it can include fewer or different cards, it frequently appears with a Deck of Many Things as part of a combined deck of sixty-six illuminated cards. The combined deck is usually protected by a box or pouch. The forty-four cards of the Deck of Many More Things bear similar imagery to those in the Deck of Many Things and have potent magical effects, which are detailed later in this description. Notably, cards from the Deck of Many More Things are more likely to be beneficial, though about a third of them are still dangerous.Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Unless a card allows you to draw additional cards, any cards drawn exceeding this number have no effect.As soon as you draw a card, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card you declared no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. Unless a card states otherwise, if you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck and take effect simultaneously.Unless it is the Fool or the Jester card, a drawn card immediately takes effect, fades from existence, and reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card multiple times.The DM can use the physical cards provided in The Deck of Many Things card set to build a combined Deck of Many Things and Deck of Many More Things, including whichever cards they desire. Alternatively, roll on the Deck of Many More Things table below to randomly determine what cards are drawn.Deck of Many More Thingsd100Card01Aberration02Balance*03Beast04Book05Bridge06Campfire07Cavern08Celestial09Comet*10Construct11Corpse12Crossroads13Donjon*14Door15Dragon16Elemental17Euryale*18Expert19Fates*20Fey21Fiend22Flames*23Fool*24Gem*25Giant26Humanoid27Jester*28Key*29Knight*30Lance31Mage32Map33Maze34Mine35Monstrosity36Moon*37Ooze38Path39Pit40Plant41Priest42Prisoner43Puzzle*44Ring45Rogue*46Ruin*47Sage*48Shield49Ship50Skull*51Staff52Stairway53Star*54Statue55Sun*56Talons*57Tavern58Temple59Throne*60Tomb61Tower62Tree63Undead64Void*65Warrior66Well67-00Roll again* Found in the Deck of Many Things as depicted in the Dungeon Master's Guide Aberration.

Any magic items you're carrying drop in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your new form.You remain transformed in this way for 2d12 days; nothing can alter your form while you're under the effects of this card, but the Wish spell can end the transformation early.

The precise location in the Feywild to which the fey crossing leads is determined by the DM. Fiend. A powerful Fiend appears in a nearby unoccupied space and offers you a deal. The precise nature of this deal is up to the DM, but usually the Fiend offers some material reward in exchange for you and your allies completing a task for the Fiend. The Fiend is indifferent to you and can be bargained with; it keeps its side of any bargain it makes, though it might twist the wording of any agreement to suit its purposes. If attacked, or if negotiations fail and you refuse the Fiend's offer, it returns to its home plane. Giant.

Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22. Prisoner. Glowing chains made of magical force appear and wrap around you.

The chains are immune to damage and can't be dispelled using the Dispel Magic spell or similar magic. However, a Disintegrate spell destroys the chains instantly, freeing you. Another creature can also free you by succeeding on a DC 30 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. Ring. A rare or rarer magic ring appears on your finger. If you have the attunement slots available, you're automatically attuned to the ring when it appears. The DM chooses the ring. Shield. A rare or rarer suit of magic armor that you are proficient with appears in your hands. The DM chooses the armor. If you lack proficiency with any armor, your base AC instead now equals 12 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor. Ship. You gain proficiency in three skills chosen by the DM. Staff. A rare or rarer magic rod, staff, or wand appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item. Stairway. You can choose to either decrease your number of declared draws by two or receive a rare or rarer wondrous item, which appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item. Statue.

Once the entity has answered your call for divine intervention or resurrected you, the entity is no longer bound to aid you. Tomb. At any time you choose within 1 year of drawing this card, you can cast the True Resurrection spell once without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice). Tower. Draw two additional cards beyond your declared number of draws. The magic of these cards doesn't immediately take effect; instead, choose one of the two additional cards to keep, returning the other to the deck. The magic of the card you keep takes effect immediately thereafter. Tree. Your skin immediately becomes rough, like tree bark. Your base AC now equals 15 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor, but you have vulnerability to fire damage. This transformation can be undone only by the Wish spell, divine intervention, or similar magic. Undead. Somewhere on the Material Plane, a revenant rises. This revenant blames you for its existence and relentlessly hunts you to exact its revenge. The revenant exists until either 1 year passes, the revenant kills you, or you use a Wish spell to banish it permanently to the afterlife. Warrior. Your Strength score increases by 2 to a maximum of 22. Well. You learn three cantrips of your choice from any spell list."
"Deck of Many Things","BMT","13","legendary","wondrous item","","","","","","","A Deck of Many Things typically appears not as individual cards, but as a collection of cards characters can draw from. But this doesn't have to be true; you can give each card a property as a standalone item, so characters who find only one card can still enjoy this famed item and use the card on adventures.This approach is particularly useful if you make a Deck of Many Things the object of a quest; as the characters explore, each card they find grants them a magical ability they can use in subsequent adventures to find the cards that remain. Eventually the heroes assemble the entire deck, which they can then use in the traditional manner, drawing transformative cards from it in a fitting climax to the campaign.This deck item comprises the following individual cards:Balance CardComet CardDonjon CardEuryale CardFates CardFlames CardFool CardGem CardJester CardKey CardKnight CardMoon CardPuzzle CardRogue CardRuin CardSage CardSkull CardStar CardSun CardTalons CardThrone CardVoid Card"

Two of the cards in a deck of many things can earn a character the enmity of another being. With the Flames card, the enmity is overt.

Seeking out the fiend shouldn't be a simple task, and the adventurer should clash with the devil's allies and followers a few times before being able to confront the devil itself.In the case of the Rogue card, the enmity is secret and should come from someone thought to be a friend or an ally. As Dungeon Master, you should wait for a dramatically appropriate moment to reveal this enmity, leaving the adventurer guessing who is likely to become a betrayer.Playing CardCardAce of diamondsVizier*King of diamondsSunQueen of diamondsMoonJack of diamondsStarTwo of diamondsComet*Ace of heartsThe Fates*King of heartsThroneQueen of heartsKeyJack of heartsKnightTwo of heartsGem*Ace of clubsTalons*King of clubsThe VoidQueen of clubsFlamesJack of clubsSkullTwo of clubsIdiot*Ace of spadesDonjon*King of spadesRuinQueen of spadesEuryaleJack of spadesRogueTwo of spadesBalance*Joker (with TM)Fool*Joker (without TM)Jester* Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards Vizier.

It appears in a space of the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone.

Using the Deck of Several Things[–] The special nature of this deck (carried by Mary Greymalkin if she is used as an NPC) means that many of its effects operate only within and with respect to this specific adventure. This typically covers any time the characters spend between setting out for the Barrier Peaks and the resolution of whatever events transpire in Kwalish's lab (area O7).For cards that effectively remove a character from play for a period of time (Donjon and the Void), you can allow a player to take on the role of one of the party's NPC hirelings, or introduce a temporary character as an NPC met during the party's journey. Alternatively, you can decide that only some aspect of the character's will disappears and is imprisoned, leaving the character to operate in a robotic state until freed."

You have resistance to acid damage while you hold this staff. The staff can be used as a magic quarterstaff and deals an extra 1d4 acid damage to any target it hits.In addition, you can use an action to touch a Medium or smaller willing creature with the staff to cast the enlarge/reduce spell from it without requiring concentration, targeting the creature with the spell's Enlarge option.

"Hideaway Vase","TGS2","104","uncommon","wondrous item","","","","","","","This durable, ceramic vase is 3 feet tall and weighs 15 pounds. You can use an action to remove the vase's lid. When you do, you must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be shunted onto a harmless demiplane inside the vase. A Large or larger creature automatically succeeds on the saving throw, but a willing Medium or smaller creature can choose to fail it. If a creature is already on the demiplane when you remove the lid, that creature reappears in the nearest unoccupied space, and you automatically succeed on the saving throw. Immediately after opening the vase in this way, the lid flies back and reseals the vase.While on this demiplane, you can't move and are blinded, but can hear everything outside of the vase as if you were standing in its space. You can leave this demiplane using an action to reappear in the nearest unoccupied space. When you attempt to leave the demiplane, a creature outside the vase can use its reaction to hold the vase's lid shut and make a DC 25 Strength check, preventing you from leaving on a success.The vase has AC 12, 30 hit points, and is vulnerable to bludgeoning damage. The vase is destroyed if it drops to 0 hit points. If the vase is destroyed while a creature is on its demiplane, that creature is forced into the nearest unoccupied space. Once a creature leaves the demiplane, the vase's lid can't be removed again for 24 hours.You can remain on the demiplane for up to 8 hours or until the vase is placed inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item, at which time you are forcefully shunted out of it. If the lid is successfully held in place when you would be forcefully shunted from the demiplane in this way, the vase shatters and is destroyed.While holding the vase, you can use an action to change the style, color, and apparent quality of the vessel. The vase's weight doesn't change. Regardless of its appearance, the vase can't be anything but a vase."

It predates the establishment of any church in Barovia. According to legend, it was delivered to a paladin named Lugdana by a giant raven—or an angel in the form of a giant raven. Lugdana used the holy symbol to root out and destroy nests of vampires until her death. The high priests of Ravenloft kept and wore the holy symbol after Lugdana's passing.The holy symbol is a platinum amulet shaped like the sun, with a large crystal embedded in its center.The holy symbol has 10 charges for the following properties.

"Homeroot","TGS2","105","rare","wondrous item","","","","","","","This piece of gnarled root has several bulbous openings along its twisted length. Enchanted by powerful druids, this root has a tiny door and a small, chimney-like protrusion from its larger end. While holding it, a tiny plume of illusory smoke emanates from the chimney.You can bury and plant this root in soil over the course of 1 minute. If the root remains buried for 1 hour, it then immediately grows underground to create a comfortable, wooden dwelling (provided that there's enough room to grow), and a stump appears from the ground where the root was buried. The stump has a simple round door carved into it that is large enough for a Medium or smaller creature to enter. The door appears and opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime of opening. The door opens to reveal a tunnel 15 feet deep and lined with ladder-like rungs made of twisting roots. At the bottom of the tunnel is a large, circular room that's 30 feet in diameter with 10-foot-high ceilings. The room is brightly lit by bioluminescent fungi that grow along its wooden walls and ceiling. You can magically control the light in the room by touching the luminous fungi, allowing you to fill the room with total darkness, dim light, or bright light.A single hallway leads away from the room. Four doors line the hallway, which each lead to a room that's 10 feet in diameter with a 10-foot-high ceiling. Every room is decorated with various pieces of wooden furniture made from coiled roots and other magically occurring plant growth, such as tables, chairs, or a bed, depending on the needs of the creature who planted the root.At the end of the hallway hangs a single red root. You can use a bonus action to pull the root to cause the hallway to extend upward into a tunnel, complete with a root-like ladder, and create a second, temporary entrance to the dwelling in an unoccupied space 60 feet away from the entrance stump. The temporary entrance is well-hidden, noticeable only with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, and remains until the start of your next turn.A creature that casts the plant growth spell as an action can redesign the appearance and furniture in one of the dwelling's rooms. If the spell is cast over the course of 8 hours, the creature can redesign the appearance and furniture of the entire dwelling instead, except for the location of the entrance stump. A conscious druid or ranger inside the dwelling is aware of any Small or larger creature that comes within 60 feet of the dwelling's entrance, and magically knows only the creature's size and gait, such as the gallop of a horse or walk of a humanoid.The entrance stump has 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a plant growth spell cast on the stump can repair it, with each casting restoring 10 hit points to it, or all its hit points if cast over the course of 8 hours. If the stump is destroyed, the dwelling collapses and magically shunts anything inside it (other than the furniture) to the nearest unoccupied space next to where the root was buried. When this happens, the earth magically returns to the way it was before the root was buried."

The circle appears as a trail of dirt or similar muck from the bottom of the shoe, and is treated as a permanent one for the purposes of this spell. Speaking the first command word again destroys the first circle, magically cleaning the surface it was placed on, before creating a new one at your location.You can speak the boots' second command word as an action while wearing them to cast the teleportation circle spell, except that this circle is only 5 feet in diameter. This circle's sigil sequence matches the one created by the first command word and links to its location. When it's created, the circle appears under your feet, centered on your location, and you immediately teleport through it. Only a circle created in this way can connect to the permanent one created by the boots' first command word. If the permanent circle is washed away or otherwise cleaned or destroyed before you speak the second command word, the spell fails and the circle isn't created.Once you use the boots to teleport in this way, they can't do so again until 1d3 days have passed. In the meantime, you can still speak the boots' first command word."

"Iggwilv's Cauldron","WBtW","209","artifact","wondrous item","requires attunement by a spellcaster","","","","80 lb.","","Iggwilv crafted this wondrous cauldron with the help of her adoptive mother, the archfey Baba Yaga. The cauldron has two forms. Only Iggwilv or Baba Yaga can change the cauldron from one form to another (by using an action to touch it), which either can do without being attuned to the item. In its first form, the cauldron is made of solid gold and embossed on the outside with images of bare-branched trees, falling leaves, and broomsticks. In its second form, the cauldron is made of iron and embossed on the outside with images of bats, toads, cats, lizards, and snakes—eight of each animal. In either form, the cauldron is roughly 3 feet in diameter and has a 2-foot-wide mouth, a round lid with a molded handle at the top, and eight clawed feet for stability. The cauldron weighs 80 pounds when empty, and it can hold up to 100 gallons of liquid. Attunement. Any Humanoid creature that attunes to the cauldron must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be aged to the point of decrepitude. In this state, the creature's speed is halved, the range of its vision and hearing is reduced to 30 feet, and it has disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The creature will reach the end of its natural life span in 3d8 days. Only a wish spell or divine intervention can reverse this aging effect on the creature.Three hags can attune to the cauldron simultaneously, provided they have formed a coven. If the coven disbands, the attunement ends for all three hags. Random Properties. Regardless of the form it takes, the cauldron has the following random properties:1 minor beneficial property (determined by rolling on the Minor Beneficial Properties table in the Dungeon Master's Guide)1 minor detrimental property (determined by rolling on the Minor Detrimental Properties table in the Dungeon Master's Guide) Gold Cauldron. The gold cauldron has the following properties:If water is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it transforms into a hearty, hot stew that provides one nourishing meal for up to four people per gallon of water used. The stew remains hot while in the cauldron, then cools naturally after it is removed. The outside of the cauldron remains safe to touch despite the heat of the stew.If wine is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 10 minutes, it transforms into a magical elixir that fortifies up to four people per gallon of wine used. Any creature that imbibes the elixir gains 10 temporary hit points. Any of the elixir that isn't consumed within 1 hour vanishes. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.When the cauldron is filled with 90 gallons of water mixed with 10 gallons of wine, it can be used as the focus for a scrying spell. When this spell is cast using the cauldron as its focus, the target of the spell fails its saving throw automatically, and the spell works even if its caster and the target are on different planes of existence. When the spell ends, all the liquid in the cauldron vanishes.Dipping the bristles of an ordinary broom into the water-filled cauldron transforms the broom into a broom of flying for 3 days. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn. Iron Cauldron. The iron cauldron has the following properties:You can use an action to scream into the empty cauldron, which magically summons a swarm of bats that flies out of the cauldron and acts immediately after you in the initiative order. The swarm obeys your commands and disappears after 1 minute if it hasn't been destroyed by then. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.If at least 1 gallon of blood is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it turns into a cloud of harmless black smoke that erupts from the cauldron and dissipates quickly. At the same time, all Humanoid creatures within a certain radius of the cauldron fall unconscious for 1 hour, except those that are attuned to the cauldron or immune to being charmed. The radius of the effect is 100 feet per gallon of blood used. An unconscious creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.Tying a dead frog or toad to the end of an ordinary branch and dipping it in the water-filled cauldron transforms the branch into a wand of polymorph with 3 charges. This wand can't recharge and crumbles to ashes when its final charge is expended. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again for 8 days.If you spend 1 minute touching the cauldron with a unicorn's horn while reciting the poem called ""The Witch Queen's Cauldron"" (see the accompanying sidebar), all creatures within 1,000 feet of the cauldron except those that are attuned to it become frozen in time. A time-frozen creature is incapacitated, can't move or speak, doesn't age, and is unaware of its surroundings or the passage of time. Moreover, it can't be moved, harmed in any way, or affected by any other magic. All other conditions and effects on the creature are suppressed until it is no longer frozen in time. Destroying the cauldron, sending it to another plane of existence, or touching it with a unicorn's horn for 1 minute while reciting ""The Witch Queen's Cauldron"" ends the time-freezing effect on all creatures. The effect also ends on any creature that comes into contact with an antimagic field or is touched by a unicorn's horn. Destroying the Cauldron. The cauldron is a Medium object with AC 19, 80 hit points, and immunity to damage from any source other than a flame tongue or frost brand weapon. Reducing the cauldron to 0 hit points with such a weapon shatters the cauldron into eight pieces of roughly equal size, whereupon all ongoing effects created by the cauldron end as it loses its magic.The destruction of Iggwilv's Cauldron causes all hags in the multiverse to lose the Shared Spellcasting trait gained by being in a coven (see the ""Hag Covens"" sidebar in the Monster Manual). Reconstructing the Cauldron. If all eight pieces of the shattered cauldron are within 5 feet of one another, a wish spell can reassemble them, restoring the cauldron and all its properties. The cauldron's reconstruction also restores the Shared Spellcasting trait of hag covens throughout the multiverse. The Witch Queen's Cauldron[–] As explained in the description of Iggwilv's Cauldron, the poem titled ""The Witch Queen's Cauldron"" is an incantation that hints at the time-freezing property of the artifact:“Eight cats perch atop eight dead attendingEight lizards flee from eight rats scavengingEight toads climbing meet eight dead and fallingEight snakes sneak under eight bats screamingEight eyes open, always dreamingAll on the cauldron that is ever seeming”"

Its voice is commanding, righteous, and booming. When drawn, Ignacious casts the zone of truth spell (save DC 20), and maintains concentration on it so that you don't have to. The zone of truth moves with the blade and remains centred on it. Personality. Ignacious is zealously devoted to the Sacred Flame, and has memorized every word of its holy texts. The blade wishes to be wielded by a faithful devotee of any sort; Ignacious does not care about the religious divide between the Falling Fire and the Sacred Flame so long as its wielder keeps the core tenets shared by both sects.The sword's purpose is to expose all deception and reveal the truth. It does not tolerate any falsehood, duplicitousness, or lies. The sword always knows when it hears a lie, and responds with wrathful fury. If a wielder speaks a lie, it immediately triggers a conflict. Relics of Saint Vitruvio. These holy relics of the Sacred Flame were wielded by Saint Vitruvio and are kept in several religious sites throughout Drakkenheim. The Knights of the Silver Order and the Followers of the Falling Fire now seek these relics. Not only do both factions revere Saint Vitruvio, both wish to use these relics to help advance their goals in Drakkenheim.A character attuned to three Relics of Saint Vitruvio may cast the heal spell three times per day, after which they must finish a long rest before they may do so again. In addition, that character gains the ability to attune to two additional magic items so long as those magic items are both Relics of Saint Vitruvio. Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack."

"Indigo Stray's Conviction","TGS2","108","legendary","wondrous item","requires attunement","","","","","","This set of midnight-colored gloves effervesce with slow wisps of smoke, and were famously worn by a royal assassin who had been freed of their bindings. At the hems are old, well-worn manacles that have been fastened to the gloves and magically clasp onto your forearms when worn. If you're missing any arms, hands, or fingers when you attune to the gloves, dark, smoky copies of the missing appendages magically rematerialize. The limbs are fully capable parts of your body and remain as long as you're attuned to the gloves.While attuned to the gloves, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. You can see normally in magical and nonmagical darkness within this range. If you already have darkvision, wearing the gloves increases its range by 60 feet, although you can only see within magical darkness within the first 60 feet of its range.The gloves have 7 charges which are used for the following properties while wearing them. They regain all expended charges daily at dawn. ""Allow Me!"" When an attacker that you can see within 15 feet of you deals damage to a friendly creature, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the gloves' charges to immediately move up to 15 feet, and make one weapon attack against the attacker. On a hit, you have advantage on attack rolls against that target until the end of your next turn. ""By His Will!"" You can use a bonus action to expend 3 of the gloves' charges to surround yourself with a dark, smoking aura of retribution. The aura extends from you in a 15-foot radius, creating an area of magical darkness. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. When a hostile creature enters this darkness for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 2d8 necrotic damage. If you roll an 8 on both of the damage dice for this effect, the creature becomes magically grappled by the aura's smoky tendrils. The creature remains grappled until it's no longer within the aura, or until it uses an action to make a DC 17 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (its choice), escaping the grapple on a success. The aura remains for 1 minute or until you die, are incapacitated, or end the effect early using a bonus action. ""The Price of Freedom!"" When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to expend 2 of the gloves' charge to magically take that damage, instead of the creature taking it. Alternatively, if a creature that you can see within this range becomes blinded, deafened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned, you can use this reaction to suffer the effects of that condition instead of the target creature. Flaw. The Indigo Stray's conviction compels its wearer to take swift, decisive action to prove themselves. While attuned to the gloves, you gain the following flaw: ""I will do what I must to demonstrate my ability, and I won't stop until a job is done."" In addition, if you are attuned to the bracers for 24 consecutive hours, your commitment to prove yourself drives you to obsession, and even minor acts of kindness compel you to feel heavily indebted. You can't attune to the Red Queen's burden or the Violet King's promise. If you are already attuned to either of them, your attunement to it immediately ends once this effect is extended to you. The first creature you meet who is attuned to the Violet King's promise becomes your sovereign leader, regardless of who you previously considered it to be. You become charmed by them and obey their commands to the best of your ability. If you find the Red Queen's burden or the Violet King's promise without an owner, you are compelled to protect it with your life until a rightful owner is found. These effects can be removed with a greater restoration spell, but not while you are attuned to the gloves."

Infernal puzzle boxes are used to safeguard diabolical contracts signed between devils and mortals, even after the terms of these contracts are fulfilled. An empty infernal puzzle box weighs 3 pounds regardless of the materials used to fashion it.When an object small enough to fit inside an infernal puzzle box is placed in it, the container magically seals shut around the object, and no magic can force the box open. The sealed box becomes immune to all damage as well. Every infernal puzzle box is constructed with a unique means of opening it. The trick to solving the puzzle is always mundane, never magical. Once a creature figures out the trick or sequence of steps needed to open a particular infernal puzzle box, that creature can open the box as an action, allowing access to the box's contents.A creature that spends 1 hour holding an infernal puzzle box while trying to open it can make a DC 30 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

"Keystone of Creation","AitFR-AVT","12","artifact","wondrous item","requires attunement","","","","","","A keystone of creation is a piece of the Stone of Creation, usually between 6 to 10 inches on a side, and can be rough-hewn or cleanly cut and polished by a mason attuned to the Stone of Creation. Random Properties. A keystone of creation has the following random properties:1 minor beneficial property1 beneficial manifestation1 detrimental manifestation Extradimensional Places. You can use the keystone to conjure an extradimensional space such as Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion. The easiest way is to simply cast the spell using the artifact's power, which requires no spell slots or material components. Each time you cast a spell with the artifact, the subsequent casting replaces the prior one. For more detailed control of a conjured demiplane or extradimensional space, see ""Construction Details."" Raising Structures. You can use the keystone to conjure a physical structure on the Material Plane. The easiest way is to simply cast the mighty fortress spell using the artifact's power, which requires no spell slots or material components. Each time you cast a spell with the artifact, the subsequent casting replaces the prior one. For more detailed control of a conjured demiplane or extradimensional space, see ""Construction Details."" Locations conjured by keystones cannot become permanent through repeated spell castings. Connected Spaces. You can use multiple keystones to create larger spaces, whether adjacent to each other or even interlinked. You can even combine structures on the Material Plane and extradimensional spaces this way. If you are attuned to one keystone when you attune to a second keystone, the keystones combine to become a single artifact (utilizing a single attunement slot), combining their features and their fates forevermore. You cannot attune to, and thus combine, more than three keystones at once. Destroying a Keystone. A keystone is an artifact in its own right and impervious to most damage, but a disintegrate spell is sufficient to destroy an unattuned keystone.After it has been attuned at least once, a given keystone requires attunement to maintain its magical power. Otherwise, its creations on the Material Plane gradually rot and decay over 1d12 + 1 days, and a demiplane relying on the keystone collapses over 1d20 + 10 minutes. Additional destructive forces like fire may hasten the destruction. A demiplane created or upheld by a keystone ejects all creatures within it to their home planes when it collapses.When a keystone's creation is fully destroyed, the keystone becomes an inert, powerless rock. If the Stone of Creation is destroyed, all its keystones break attunement, lose all magical properties, and their creations decay or collapse to nothing.If it reaches the Elemental Chaos or is struck by a forked, metal rod attuned to the Elemental Chaos (as per the plane shift spell), a keystone is destroyed. Construction Details[–] You can customize a keystone's creation with cosmetic details you can imagine. You can also rearrange the floorplans and structural details of your creations as follows. Demiplane Design. With a single keystone, you can conjure an extradimensional space in the shape of a dome or pyramid, up to 1 mile on each side, with whatever terrain you wish. The edges of this space are solid and impassable but may be invisible, so that your space can appear to go on forever if you wish. With additional keystones, you can add an additional square mile to your creation, adding or combining terrain types.Each square mile can include a single structure up to the size of Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion, with all the attendant servants and feasts, or any number of smaller structures that together equal a magnificent mansion in total area.You cannot create flora or fauna that deal damage or otherwise harm creatures. If you create cliffs, waters, or other natural features, however, creatures in the space might fall, drown, or otherwise be harmed. Physical Structure Design. With a single keystone, you can create a structure akin to a mighty fortress with the added flexibility to customize that fortress not only for cosmetic details but for substantive effects. With a single keystone, you can rearrange the walls, open spaces, floors, doors, and other features of the mighty fortress provided you do not exceed 150 10-foot-wide cubes of interior space. Your fortress can reach across a creek, river, or other waters. It can take reckless or even dangerous shapes to include deep pits, flooded chambers, and so on. Your design, once conjured, is not guaranteed to be capable of supporting its own weight or surviving the stresses of attacks, weather, or time.You may post any number of your structure's servants as guards, if you wish. They have statistics identical to an unseen servant with the addition of a passive Perception score equal to your own, though you cannot perceive through their senses. The servants can ring bells or otherwise manipulate the environment to raise an alarm. Manifestations. Each place or structure conjured by a keystone of creation has special, unforeseen manifestations that affect its makeup and appearance. Some manifestations are beneficial, some are detrimental. These manifestations change each time a keystone is used to conjure a structure or place. The DM may roll or choose from the following tables, or devise unique manifestations based on the specific creations being conjured."

Untold times the deck's creator, Mother Luba, narrowly escaped doom, spared only by her keen insights. But even for her, not all wickedness could be escaped.

There these foul spirits dwell still, trapped within a nether-realm hidden amid shuffling cards, waiting for fate to turn foul—as it inevitably will.Like all tarokka decks, the Tarokka of Souls is a lavishly illustrated collection of fifty-four cards, comprising the fourteen cards of the high deck and forty other cards divided into four suits: coins, glyphs, stars, and swords.

These travelers have learned many secrets of these domains and encountered countless others wandering amid the Shadowfell's horrors. Most Vistani bands accept well-intentioned wayfarers from diverse walks and of disparate origins, embracing any who seek to find a home amid the endless roads and vistas hidden amid the mists.A halfling Vistani, Mother Luba led one of the largest groups of Vistani in the Shadowfell. She hailed from the same world that Count Strahd von Zarovich and Madam Eva came from, and she created a community of kindness and resilience-ever rare to find in the Plane of Shadow. She led her people in welcoming strangers, feeding the hungry, and defying the cruel. She and Madam Eva were once friends, until Madam Eva began bargaining with the creatures of the night. ""We may wander amid the shadows,"" Mother Luba said. ""But we must ever serve as a light to our fellow travelers.""Some years ago, Mother Luba disappeared into the mists, leaving behind only the Tarokka of Souls. It is said that if you draw the Mists card from it, you can hear the whispers of her kind voice."

"Mighty Servant of Leuk-o","TCE","131","artifact","wondrous item","requires attunement","","","","","","Named for the warlord who infamously employed it, the Mighty Servant of Leuk-o is a fantastically powerful, 10-foot-tall machine that turns into an animate construct when piloted. Crafted of a gleaming black alloy of unknown origin, the servant is often described as a combination of a disproportioned dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant contains enough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compartment within, from which up to two Medium creatures can control it-and potentially execute a spree of unstoppable destruction.Tales of the servant's origins involve more conjecture than fact, often referring to otherworldly beings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the supposedly related device known as the Machine of Lum the Mad. The best details on the device's origins and operation can be found in the Mind of Metal, a tome of artificer's secrets that connects the device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, and which was written by Lum the Mad's several times over granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, while she reconstructed the long disassembled Mighty Servant of Leuk-o. Dangerous Attunement. Two creatures can be attuned to the servant at a time. If a third creature tries to attune to it, nothing happens.The servant's controls are accessed by a hatch in its upper back, which is easily opened while there are no creatures attuned to the artifact.Attuning to the artifact requires two hours, which can be undertaken as part of a long rest, during which time you must be inside the servant, interacting with its controls. While crew members are attuning themselves, any creature or structure outside and within 50 feet of the servant has a 25 percent chance of being accidentally targeted by one of its Destructive Fist attacks once during the attunement. This process must be undergone every time a creature attunes itself to the artifact. Controlling the Servant. While any creatures are attuned to the artifact, attuned creatures can open the hatch as easily as any other door. Other creatures can open the hatch as an action with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. A knock spell cast on the hatch also opens it until the start of the caster's next turn.A creature can enter or exit through the hatch by spending 10 feet of movement. Those inside the servant have total cover from effects originating outside it. The controls within it allow creatures to see outside without obstruction.While you are inside the servant, you can command it by using the controls. During your turn (for either attuned creature), you can command it in the following ways:Open or close the hatch (no action required, once per turn)Move the servant up to its speed (no action required)As an action, you can command the servant to take one of the actions in its stat block or some other action.When a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the servant, you can use your reaction to command the servant to make one Destructive Fist attack against that creature.While there are no attuned creatures inside the servant, it is an inert object. Ghost in the Machine. Upon his death, the soul of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the artifact and has become its animating force. The servant has been known to attack or move of its own accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruction. Once every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM's discretion, takes one action while uncrewed.If the servant loses half of its hit points or more, each creature attuned to it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 24 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature goes on a destructive spree, seeking to destroy structures and attack any unattuned creatures within sight of the servant, starting with those threatening the artifact-preferably using the servant, if possible. Self-Destruct. By inputting a specific series of lever pulls and button presses, the servant's two crew members can cause it to explode. The self-destruct code is not revealed to crew members when they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered (the DM determines how), it requires two attuned crew members to be inside the servant and spend their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing the command. Should the crew members begin the process of entering the code, though, the servant uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns the crew members against each other.If the crew members successfully implement the code, at the end of the third round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on the servant must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 87 (25d6) force damage, 87 (25d6) lightning damage, and 87 (25d6) thunder damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. Objects and structures in the area take triple damage. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly and leave behind no remains.This does not destroy the servant permanently. Rather, 2d6 days later, its parts—left arm, left leg, right arm, right leg, lower torso, and upper torso—drop from the sky in random places within 1,000 miles of the explosion. If brought within 5 feet of one another, the pieces reconnect and reform the servant. Destroying the Servant. The servant can be destroyed in two ways. After it has self-destructed, its disconnected pieces can be melted down in one of the forge-temples of its ancient Olman creators. Alternatively, if the servant strikes the Machine of Lum the Mad, both artifacts explode in an eruption that is three times the size and three times the damage as the servant's self-destruct property."

Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals, its loyalty is absolute.If a moon blade has a flaw, it is overconfidence.

"Morath, Scepter of the Soul Vortex","TGS2","198","artifact","rod","requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard","","","","","","This torch-like scepter almost hums with necrotic energy and appeared when the first soul was returned to the Material Plane after its death. Since then, it has been lost and found throughout its gruesome, storied history.While attuned to the rod, you have resistance to necrotic damage, and you know the chill touch cantrip as if it were from your class's spell list. If you are a warlock, you also gain a +3 bonus to your spell attack rolls and saving throw DCs of your warlock spells while holding the rod.An eerie, green flame erupts from the head of this rod when you hold it, shedding bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. While holding the rod, you can use a bonus action to mentally snuff out or relight the flames. While the flames are lit, you can use an action to make a ranged spell attack with it, using your spell attack bonus, out to a range of 30 feet. When you do, the flaming rod emits a phantasmal skull that flies out to attack the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 necrotic damage, and if the target is a creature, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt. The skull disappears immediately after the attack. Random Properties. Morath, the Scepter of the Soul Vertex has the following random properties:1 minor beneficial property1 minor detrimental property1 major detrimental property Spells. The rod has 8 charges and regains 1d3 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. When you reduce a humanoid to 0 hit points, the rod regains 1 expended charge. While holding the rod, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell attack bonus and spell save DC: bestow curse (1 charge), circle of death (4 charges), confusion (2 charges), insect plague (3 charges), ray of enfeeblement (1 charge), or speak with dead (1 charge). Bestow Greater Curse. When you cast the bestow curse spell while holding the rod using either the rod or a spell slot, you can choose to force the creature to make the saving throw with disadvantage. On a failed save, the target is simultaneously cursed by all four of the spell's listed options. Once this property has been used, it can't be used again until the next dawn. Death Grip. While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast the finger of death spell from it, using your spell save DC. Once the rod has been used to cast this spell, it can't do so again until the next dawn. Sentience. Morath, Scepter of the Soul Vortex is a sentient chaotic evil rod with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 13, and Charisma of 14. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The rod communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common. While you are attuned to it, it also understands every language you know. It can choose to communicate with other creatures by manifesting the phantasmal skull above the rod and using it to speak. Personality. The rod is possessed by Morath, the first human to ever die, and is an independent spirit from within the Thousand Voices, the largest collection of discordant lost souls found within the multiverse. Morath's time on the Material Plane was short, but filled with pain and confusion. As a result, Morath seeks to experience humankind's most base desires vicariously through the actions of the rod's wielder, often attempting to compel the wielder to give in to such urges in moments of weakness. Curse. The rod bears a curse that affects any non-human that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. When you die while cursed in this way, you must make a Charisma saving throw against your own spell save DC. On a failed save, or if the rod is more than 100 feet away from you when you die, your soul is immediately siphoned into and becomes a part of the Thousand Voices, leaving your body a vacant husk and unable to return to life by any means short of a wish spell. On a successful save, your soul leaves your body and enters the rod, as if you had cast the magic jar spell, using the rod as a container. You can only return to your body if it's holding the rod, but can otherwise gain the benefits of the spell as normal. If your soul returns to your body, you return to life with 1 hit point. While your soul is detached from your body in this way, your attunement to the rod is carried over to any other creature you possess for the duration. Destroying the Scepter. The only way to destroy the rod is to destroy Morath while your soul is contained within the rod. When you do, use your original body's statistics and abilities for your soul, with the exception that your hit point maximum is halved. Use the archmage stat block for Morath's soul. From outside the rod, this combat resolves instantaneously, regardless of how much time passed within the rod during the battle. If you die while within the rod in this way, your soul is lost to the Thousand Voices. If Morath dies, the rod is destroyed and you return to your body with 1 hit point, regardless of where your body is at the time."

While wearing the gauntlets, you have resistance to necrotic damage.The gauntlets have 12 charges and regain 1d6 + 6 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the gauntlets, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from them using a spell attack bonus of +8: chill touch (no charges, or 1 to cast at 5th level), inflict wounds (1 charge per spell level, up to 5th), or vampiric touch (3 charges). Damage dealt by these spells ignores resistance to necrotic damage.In addition, if you spend a charge to cast chill touch from the gauntlets and hit a creature, you can immediately choose to expend additional charges to cast either the inflict wounds or vampiric touch spell from them as part of the action to cast the cantrip. When you do, the cantrip's skeletal hand delivers the spell to the target, instead of requiring you to touch it. If you were already concentrating on the vampiric touch spell when you hit a creature with chill touch in this way (after spending a charge to cast it), you don't need to expend any additional charges to deliver your vampiric touch spell to the target. Necrotic damage dealt by chill touch doesn't count toward the amount dealt by vampiric touch for the purpose of calculating the number of hit points you regain from the spell."

While the candle burns, ghostly hands reach out from the holder as if to warm their hands by the tiny fire.If you're holding the lit candle and its holder while attuned to it, will-o'-wisps are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them. In addition, you can use an action to cast the blink spell from it. For the duration of the spell, whenever you vanish from your current plane of existence, a will-o'-wisp appears in your space there instead. The will-o'-wisp's turn is immediately after your own, and it obeys your mental commands (no action required by you). The will-o'-wisp vanishes when you return from the Ethereal Plane or when it's reduced to 0 hit points, at which point you return early to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from.Once the candle and holder have been used to cast this spell, it can't do so again until the next dusk."

As a bonus action, you can speak the armor's command word to surround yourself with an aura of grim blasphemy. The aura remains for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated or die. For the duration, celestials have disadvantage on attack rolls against you, and the first time that a celestial moves within 5 feet of you on its turn or starts its turn there, that creature takes 1d10 necrotic damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity. In addition, once before the aura ends, if you fail a saving throw against an effect from a celestial (such as a solar's Slaying Longbow), you can choose to succeed instead.

"Mudslick Tower","PaBTSO","219","very rare","wondrous item","","","","","","","You can use an action to place this 1-inch-diameter granite sphere on the ground and speak its command word, which is ""petrification"" in Terran. The sphere rapidly grows into a stout tower that remains until you use an action to touch the tower and speak the command word again, whereupon the tower shrinks back to a 1-inch-diameter granite sphere. The tower must be empty to shrink in this way. The tower bristles with muddy knobs that constantly extrude and retract across its surface, as though the tower were breathing through a coating of thick mud.Each creature in the area where the tower appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the tower. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.Whenever it expands, the mudslick tower merges with any natural stone it touches, awkwardly tipping and wedging itself to touch as much natural stone as it can.The tower is 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime of opening.Although it looks like stone, the tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents creatures from tipping it over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. While merged with natural stone, the mudslick tower has immunity to all damage. Only a wish spell can repair the tower (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points."

"Murgaxor's Orb","SCC","126","legendary","wondrous item","requires attunement","","","","","","Roiling green mist fills this glass orb, which the exiled Strixhaven mage Murgaxor once used in foul magical experiments. Murgaxor's spirit has infused the orb, which he uses to spread a terrible curse among Strixhaven's students. Sentience. Murgaxor's orb is a sentient, chaotic evil magic item with the following properties:The orb has an Intelligence of 20, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 16, as well as hearing and darkvision out to a range of 30 feet.The orb can speak, read, and understand Common, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature touching it.At any time during your turn, the orb can cast the suggestion spell (save DC 17), targeting you or one other creature that touched the orb within the last 24 hours. This isn't a power of the orb that you control. Curse. Any Humanoid you touch while holding the orb must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or become cursed. Each creature cursed by the orb bears an echo of Murgaxor's hateful thoughts, and that creature suffers from headaches that are persistent but not debilitating until the curse ends. On your turn, the orb can use an action to produce one of the following effects, targeting one or more creatures it has cursed: Unconsciousness. The cursed creature falls unconscious for 1 hour. The creature is roused if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. Visions of Terror. The cursed creature sees terrifying visions, causing it to view all creatures that aren't also cursed as dangerous monsters for 10 minutes. The cursed creature must use its action each round to make one attack against the nearest non-cursed creature. If the cursed creature has multiple possible targets, it attacks one at random. This effect ends if the cursed creature is incapacitated.After either of these effects ends, the affected creature is no longer cursed. The curse can also be removed from a creature with a remove curse spell or similar magic. All cases of the curse end if Murgaxor's orb is destroyed. Magical Signature. As a side effect of the orb's curse, the spell detect magic reveals an aura of enchantment surrounding creatures bearing the curse. This aura is distinctive, but in a way detect magic offers no further details about. Destroying the Orb. Murgaxor's orb has AC 18; 20 hit points; immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage; and resistance to all other types of damage. If reduced to 0 hit points, the orb shatters."

The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features—such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons—that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp.

Using the brush and expending 1 pot of pigment, you can paint any number of three-dimensional objects and terrain features (such as walls, doors, trees, flowers, weapons, webs, and pits), provided these elements are all confined to a 20-foot Cube.

If your Concentration is broken or you leave the Cube before the work is done, all the painted elements vanish, and the pot of pigment is wasted.When the work is done, all the painted objects and terrain features become real. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door, which can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit creates a real pit, the entire depth of which must lie within the 20-foot Cube.No object created by a pot of pigment can have a value greater than 25 GP, and the total value of all objects created by a pot of pigment can't exceed 500 GP.

Standing two feet high, the orrery housing is a wondrous device imbued with magic of its own, but the power of its six clockwork components makes the artifact even more potent.The Orrery of the Wanderer was created by a renowned clockwork mage known only as Lottie. She crafted the relic as a means of tapping into the power of the planes, and to channel the divination and foretelling powers of the stars. But Lottie soon realized that her creation was far more powerful than she had intended. As it tapped into planar magic, the orrery began to manifest the darkness and malevolence inherent to some of the planes. Eventually, it would impress upon its owner a desire to open portals into the most cursed and dangerous worlds, including the Far Realm.To prevent the orrery from ever being so used, Lottie scattered the components that powered it, secreting them across the world. But the orrery's instinct for survival is strong, and its components have a way of inexorably coming together over decades or centuries, found by treasure hunters, stolen by monsters, found and stolen again—and moving closer to each other all the time.Random Properties.

Magic items that incorporate at least an ounce of whitestone into their construction require only one-quarter the creation time of other magic items. Some alchemists in Emon have discovered that dissolving whitestone with specific acids can leave behind pure residuum, which can substitute for expensive spell components when such materials are not readily available.If a spell has a component cost that consumes the component, its caster can substitute the required component for an amount of residuum of an equal value. One pound of pure residuum is worth approximately 500 gp in most markets, though it becomes extremely expensive and difficult to find outside of Emon or the city of Whitestone itself.Residuum can also be heated and blown into glass, forming a shimmering, greenish surface. Residuum slates or orbs can be used in stationary enchanting tables. Archmages willing to pay exorbitant rates—easily 20,000 gp or more—may acquire an enchanting slate that can be used to expedite the creation of all magic items.

It is measured in livestock, grain, land, rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources (such as a mine or a forest).Guilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade.

"Ring of Winter","ToA","207","artifact","ring","requires attunement","","","","1 lb.","","Artus Cimber has kept this item in his possession for over a century. The Ring of Winter is a golden band that resizes to fit snugly on the finger of its wearer. A thin layer of frost coats the outside of the ring, which normal heat can't melt. The ring feels ice cold to the touch and initially numbs the hand that wears it, but this cold ceases to be felt by one who is attuned to this ring.The Ring of Winter is sentient and tries to take control of any creature that wears it (see ""Sentient Magic Items"" chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). If it succeeds, the ring compels its wearer to cause undue harm to everyone and everything around it, in a cold-hearted attempt to incur the wrath of enemies and bring the wearer's doom. Sentience. The Ring of Winter is a sentient chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 17. The ring communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it, and it has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The ring craves destruction, and it likes inflicting indiscriminate harm on others. Nondetection. The Ring of Winter defies attempts to magically locate it. Neither the ring nor its wearer can be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors. Frozen Time. As long as you wear the ring, you don't age naturally. This effect is similar to suspended animation, in that your age doesn't catch up to you once the ring is removed. The ring doesn't protect its wearer from magical or supernatural aging effects, such as the Horrifying Visage of a ghost. Cold Immunity. While attuned to and wearing the ring, you have immunity to cold damage and don't suffer any ill effects from extreme cold (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon's Master Guide). Magic. The Ring of Winter has 12 charges and regains all its expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can expend the necessary number of charges to activate one of the following properties:You can expend 1 charge as an action and use the ring to lower the temperature in a 120-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 300 feet of you. The temperature in that area drops 20 degrees per minute, to a minimum of -30 degrees Fahrenheit. Frost and ice begin to form on surfaces once the temperature drops below 32 degrees. This effect is permanent unless you use the ring to end it as an action, at which point the temperature in the area returns to normal at a rate of 10 degrees per minute.You can cast one of the following spells from the ring (spell save DC 17) by expending the necessary number of charges: Bigby's hand (2 charges; the hand is made of ice, is immune to cold damage, and deals bludgeoning damage instead of force damage as a clenched fist), cone of cold (2 charges), flesh to ice (3 charges; as flesh to stone except that the target turns to solid ice with the density and durability of stone), ice storm (2 charges), Otiluke's freezing sphere (3 charges), sleet storm (1 charge), spike growth (1 charge; the spikes are made of ice), or wall of ice (2 charges).You can expend the necessary number of charges as an action and use the ring to create either an inanimate ice object (2 charges) or an animated ice creature (4 charges). The ice object can't have any moving parts, must be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability of metal or stone (your choice). The ice creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. The ice creature obeys only its creator's commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses 5 (1d10) hit points per minute as it melts. Use the guidelines in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the hit points of an inanimate object if they become necessary. Other Properties. The Ring of Winter is rumored to possess other properties that can be activated only by an evil being whose will the ring can't break. Frost giants have long believed that the ring can be used to freeze entire worlds, while a djinni in the service of a Calishite pasha once claimed that the ring could be used to summon and control white dragons, as well as the mighty ice primordial named Cryonax. Destroying the Ring. The ring is nigh indestructible, resisting even the most intense magical heat. If it is placed on the finger of the powerful archfey known as the Summer Queen, the ring melts away and is destroyed forever."

A symbol of his authority, Moghadam carries the weapon during the time frame of the adventure to intimidate the tomb's workers. (In later years, after Acererak trapped Moghadam in the completed tomb as an undead archwraith, Moghadam was able to use the weapon as his own phylactery.)A small jade version of the green devil face of the Tomb of Horrors is fashioned into the hilt of the weapon, with the blade extending from its open mouth. The blade always appears ruined and rusting, and causes its surroundings to appear reflected in the blade as if in a state of decay.You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit an undead creature with it, the attack deals an extra 1d8 force damage.In addition, the weapon has the following properties: Blighted Ruin. You can cast the blight spell from the weapon (DC 15). Once used, this property of the weapon can't be used until the next dawn. Destructive Ruin. You can cast the disintegrate spell from the weapon, but can target only a nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. Once used, this property of the weapon can't be used until dawn seven days later. Curse. This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with a remove curse spell or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the weapon.The weapon must take direct part in the destruction of 1,000 gp worth of materials and objects every seven days, or a conflict arises between you and the weapon at the end of the seventh day. Sentience. Ruinblade is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 8, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is a rough, ruined echo. While you are attuned to it, Ruinblade also understands every language you know. Personality. Ruinblade speaks either with a dolorous or frenetic tone, depending on its mood. That mood improves when the sword is actively engaged in acts of destruction, but worsens if the blade is left inactive too long.The weapon's purpose is to ruin and unmake existing objects, so that its owner can rebuild the world from a blank slate. It thus encourages its wielder to engage in constant destruction, claiming that this will allow the creation of a more superior vision from the ruin of what came before. Heavy. Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively. Two-Handed. This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it."

After the villain uses the ruinstone, roll a d20: on a 5-20, one of their allies disintegrates, on an 1-4, one of the player characters disintegrates.If a creature bound its soul to the ruinstone in the ""Thalivar's Beacon"" quest, the artifact explodes when used and the creature who is bound to it disintegrates, disappearing from reality and can only be brought back with a wish spell, or similar magic."

"Shield of the Hidden Lord","BGDIA","225","legendary","armor (shield)","requires attunement","AC +2","","","6 lb.","","The Shield of the Hidden Lord is of celestial origin and serves as a prison for the pit fiend Gargauth, whose mortal followers revere it as a god. Over time, Gargauth's evil has warped the shield's appearance, so that its celestial motif and designs have become twisted into a fiendish face that subtly moves in disturbing ways.While holding this shield, you gain a +2 bonus to AC and resistance to fire damage. Sentience. The Shield of the Hidden Lord is sentient as long as it imprisons Gargauth. While sentient, the shield has the following properties:The shield has an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 18, and a Charisma of 24, as well as hearing and truesight out to a range of 120 feet.The shield can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature it can sense within 120 feet of it. Its voice is a deep, hollow whisper.The shield has 3 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast fireball or 2 charges to cast wall of fire from the shield (save DC 21 for each). The wall of fire spell lasts for 1 minute (no concentration required). The shield regains all expended charges daily at dawn.Anytime during your turn, the shield can choose to radiate an aura of dread for 1 minute. (This is not a power of the shield that you control.) Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn within 20 feet of the shield must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this power of the shield for the next 24 hours. Once the shield uses this power, it can't use it again until the next dawn. Gargauth's Personality. Gargauth desperately seeks freedom but can't escape on its own. The pit fiend won't reveal its true nature, referring to itself only as the Hidden Lord. It drops hints and subtle suggestions that it is an angel trapped in an unholy prison. If released from the shield, the pit fiend honors the terms of whatever bargain it struck to facilitate its escape.While trapped in the shield, Gargauth carefully steers the shield's current owner toward committing acts of cruelty and domination, hoping to condemn the individual's soul to the Nine Hells. Conflict occurs if the shield's owner does anything that would make it more difficult for Gargauth to escape its prison, such as leaving the shield in a place where others are unlikely to find it.Gargauth doesn't know how to escape from the shield. The pit fiend believes (incorrectly) that it can break free of the shield if it's brought to the Nine Hells, for it's convinced that the shield's powers are weaker there. Freeing Gargauth. Casting dispel evil and good on the shield has a 1 percent chance of freeing the pit fiend, or automatically succeeds if the spell is cast by a solar, a planetar, or an archdevil. A god can release the pit fiend by touching the shield and speaking Gargauth's name. When released, Gargauth appears in a random, unoccupied space as close to the shield as possible."

If you lose the contest, the snake behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the flute's music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the snake is swayed by the flute's music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the instrument. A friendly snake obeys your mental commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly snake, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly snake starts its turn and can't hear the flute's music, your control over that snake ends, and the snake behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the flute's music for the next 24 hours.

In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage. When you use this weapon to attack a creature that has at least one head and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, it doesn't have or need a head, it has legendary actions, or the DM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.While attuned to Snicker-Snack, you have proficiency with greatswords, and you can use your Charisma modifier instead of your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls made with the weapon.

Because each soul coin has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story. A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a night hag's curse. Carrying Soul Coins. To hold a soul coin is to feel the soul bound within it—overcome with rage or fraught with despair.An evil creature can carry as many soul coins as it wishes (up to its maximum weight allowance).

The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released. A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment (DM's choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from soul coins typically emerge from the River Styx as lemure devils.A soul can also be freed by destroying the coin that contains it. A soul coin has AC 19, 1 hit point for each charge it has remaining, and immunity to all damage except that which is dealt by a hellfire weapon or an infernal war machine's furnace (see ""Soul Fuel"").Freeing a soul from a soul coin is considered a good act, even if the soul belongs to an evil creature.

"Spell Bottle","EGW","269","legendary","wondrous item","requires attunement","","","","","","This glass bottle can store one spell of up to 5th level at a time. When found, roll a d6 and subtract 1; the total determines the level of spell in the bottle (the DM chooses the spell, and 0 means the bottle is empty). A swirling blue vapor fills the bottle while it contains a spell.When the bottle is empty, any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into it by touching it while casting. The spell has no effect other than to be stored in the bottle.While holding the bottle, you can cast the spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The bottle becomes empty once the spell is cast.If you're holding the empty bottle when you see a creature casting a spell within 60 feet of you, you can open the bottle as a reaction in an attempt to interrupt the spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an Intelligence check. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle."

"Spelljamming Helm","AAG","23","rare","wondrous item","requires attunement by a spellcaster","","","","","","The function of this ornate chair is to propel and maneuver a ship on which it has been installed through space and air. It can also propel and maneuver a ship on water or underwater, provided the ship is built for such travel. The ship in question must weigh 1 ton or more.The sensation of being attuned to a spelljamming helm is akin to the pins-and-needles effect one experiences after one's arm or leg falls asleep, but not as painful.While attuned to a spelljamming helm and sitting in it, you gain the following abilities for as long as you maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell):You can use the spelljamming helm to move the ship through space, air, or water up to the ship's speed. If the ship is in space and no other objects weighing 1 ton or more are within 1 mile of it, you can use the spelljamming helm to move the vessel fast enough to travel 100 million miles in 24 hours.You can steer the vessel, albeit in a somewhat clumsy fashion, in much the way that a rudder or oars can be used to maneuver a seafaring ship.At any time, you can see and hear what's happening on and around the vessel as though you were standing in a location of your choice aboard it. Transfer Attunement. You can use an action to touch a willing spellcaster. That creature attunes to the spelljamming helm immediately, and your attunement to it ends. Cost of a Spelljamming Helm[–] A spelljamming helm propels and steers a ship much as sails, oars, and rudders work on a seafaring vessel, and a spelljamming helm is easy to create if one has the proper spell. Create spelljamming helm has a material component cost of 5,000 gp, so that's the least one can pay to acquire a spelljamming helm.Wildspace merchants, including dohwars and mercanes (both described in Boo's Astral Menagerie), typically sell a spelljamming helm for substantially more than it cost to make. How much more depends on the market, but 7,500 gp would be a reasonable demand. A desperate buyer in a seller's market might pay 10,000 gp or more."

On subsequent rounds, reading the text or scribing new text on blank ""pages"" in the shard requires concentration (as if concentrating on a spell) and takes the same amount of time it takes you to read and write normally.

"Stone of Creation","AitFR-AVT","10","artifact","wondrous item","requires attunement","","","","","","Rare legends and lore that speak of the Stone of Creation claim it fell to the Material Plane like a meteor from some distant edge of the Outer Planes or the Far Realm. Similar legends across various worlds, all describing stones that grow buildings and islands from magic, like a house from a seed, suggest the Stone of Creation is not a unique artifact—or that all the various pieces of it are derived from a single source of stone even larger than sages imagine.The raw, black stone appears flaky like slate but is as hard as granite and marbled with veins of gold and platinum. The original, complete Stone of Creation took the form of a blocky slab like a standing stone, but it may be impossible to know the Stone's true size, or if the concept of a ""whole"" Stone of Creation even applies to the artifact. Perhaps other slabs and boulders made from the Stone have been scattered across the multiverse, being cut down and recombed through interplanar movements and the magic of the artifacts themselves. Random Properties. The Stone of Creation has the following random properties:2 minor beneficial properties1 major beneficial property Stone Smithing. While attuned to the Stone of Creation, you are proficient with mason's tools and can use them to cut pieces from the Stone's slab, thereby creating lesser artifacts. Cut into Pieces. The Stone of Creation is a source for smaller artifacts that derive their power from it. These pieces allow you to shape and bestow a portion of the slab's power for yourself or others.You can cut pieces in two general sizes: a chip of creation or a keystone of creation. These lesser artifacts require their own attunement.Up to eleven chips of creation can be created from the existing slab, plus up to nine keystones. A chip resembles a flake of rock about the size of an adult human's hand. A keystone is at least five times that thickness.When all chips and keystones have been cut away, a portion of the Stone remains but proves impervious to additional attempts to cut or chisel pieces from it. This smallest version of the Stone is the same size as a Tiny creature. Raze or Reshape Creations. Although the Stone of Creation cannot create structures or demiplanes of its own, while you are attuned to it you can revise or renovate any structure or demiplane created by a keystone or chip, provided you are within 1 mile of the Stone and you can see or otherwise perceive the structure or demiplane. For example, you may add doors, seal windows, change the arrangement of rooms, or even dispel a structure created by a keystone. To do so, you must concentrate for 1 minute, as if on a spell, while picturing the changes you wish to make in your mind; over the course of that minute, the changes slowly occur. These changes cannot deal damage or directly harm a creature. A dispelled structure gradually recedes and diminishes to nothing, leaving creatures unharmed. Destroying the Stone. The Stone of Creation is a strange artifact that can be divided into smaller artifacts, yet the Stone is impervious to most damage. Only the smith attuned to the Stone can carve it. Destroying the Stone's lesser, derived artifacts (and their creations) does no damage to the Stone itself.The Stone of Creation is destroyed if it reaches the Elemental Chaos or is struck with a forked metal rod attuned to the Elemental Chaos (as per the plane shift spell). The Stone then shatters into harmless, inert shards of rock. Places created by the slab's chips and keystones crumble, decay, or fade away to nothing after the Stone of Creation is destroyed. Whether the Stone of Creation is itself a piece of a larger artifact remains unknown."

When your attunement to the Stone of Golorr ends, you must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw.

In addition, the aboleth learns the greatest desires of any creature that communicates telepathically with the stone.The Stone of Golorr hungers for information and prefers not to remain in the clutches of any creature for too long. Whenever the stone desires a new owner, it demands to be given to another intelligent creature as quickly as possible. If its demands are ignored, it tries to take control of its owner (see ""Sentient Magic Items"" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). Personality. The Stone of Golorr has an alien intellect that is both domineering and hungry for knowledge. It thinks of itself as an ageless and immortal god. Destroying the Stone. While in stone form, the aboleth isn't a creature and isn't subject to effects that target creatures. The Stone of Golorr is immune to all damage. Casting an antipathy/sympathy spell on the stone destroys it if the antipathy effect is selected and the spell is directed to repel aberrations. When the spell is cast in this way, the stone transforms into mucus and is destroyed, and Golorr the aboleth appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the stone's remains. The aboleth is incensed by the stone's destruction, and it attacks all other creatures it can see."

"Sword of Kas","DMG'14","226","artifact","weapon (Longsword), martial weapon, melee weapon","requires attunement","1d8 Slashing","versatile (1d10)","","3 lb.","","When Vecna grew in power, he appointed an evil and ruthless lieutenant, Kas the Bloody Handed, to act as his bodyguard and right hand. This despicable villain served as advisor, warlord, and assassin. His successes earned him Vecna's admiration and a reward: a sword with as dark a pedigree as the man who would wield it.For a long time, Kas faithfully served the lich but as Kas's power grew, so did his hubris. His sword urged him to supplant Vecna, so that they could rule the lich's empire in Vecna's stead. Legend says Vecna's destruction came at Kas's hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant's doom, leaving only Kas's sword behind. The world was made brighter thereby.The Sword of Kas is a magic, sentient longsword that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

Killing Vecna's worshipers, destroying the lich's works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal.The Sword of Kas also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the Eye and Hand of Vecna. The sword's obsession with those artifacts eventually becomes a fixation for its wielder. Destroying the Sword. A creature attuned to both the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna can use the wish property of those combined artifacts to unmake the Sword of Kas. The creature must cast the wish spell and make a Charisma check contested by the Charisma check of the sword. The sword must be within 30 feet of the creature, or the spell fails.

When planted in this way, creatures summoned are not friendly to you and do not vanish. Some of the creatures summoned merely head off in search of home, while others act as their tales dictate. In either case, the tooth is gone forever."

"The Griffon's Saddlebag","TGS2","174","artifact","wondrous item","","","","","3 lb.","","These leather bags have the stylized face of a griffon on their front and appear across the multiverse in strange locations. One may be found in the belly of a dragon, while another in the limbs of a great tree. Regardless of where it's found, a Griffon's Saddlebag is typically discovered by an adventurer with a destiny.The saddlebags are made by a great, six-armed griffon on the Astral Plane. Believed by some to be a demigod of pocket dimensions and craftsmen everywhere, the griffon is a patron of artificers and creators across the multiverse. The griffon creates magical items in its great forge using materials collected from various planes of existence to add to its collection. While no one knows exactly how to contact the griffon, it has a knack for knowing what items are needed by whom. Superior Holding. This 1-foot-wide bag always weighs 3 pounds, regardless of what's inside it. It functions as a bag of holding that can only be pierced by another artifact. Placing a bag of holding, handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item inside the extradimensional space created by the saddlebag, or vice versa, destroys the extradimensional item but leaves the saddlebag unharmed. Any item stored within the other extradimensional space is magically moved to the space within the saddlebag instead. If doing so overloads the bag, random contents from either space are scattered in the Astral Plane. Magic Courier. At the GM's discretion, the saddlebag's beak opens up to reveal a letter. The magical script can be read by all creatures with an Intelligence score of 4 or higher. The note is a delivery request or similar that includes the name of an item as well as either specific or vague descriptions of a person or place. At the bottom of the letter is a price listed in coins or other form of payment, as well as a date or time depending on its urgency.If the saddlebag is brought to the described person or place within the allotted time, it dispenses the magical item into the hand of the appropriate recipient. If the payment isn't received by the bag within 1 hour of dispensing the magic item, the item vanishes and is lost. After receiving the payment for an item in this way, the bag's beak reopens to dispense a reward for the courier. Sell Magic Items. The saddlebag has a connection to the griffon's forge on the Astral Plane. Depending on the magic item, you can sell a magic item to the saddlebag for half the cost of its base price. Spells. The saddlebag has 8 charges and regains 1d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the saddlebag, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the following spells from it: detect magic (1 charge), identify (1 charge), or legend lore (5 charges). Additional Spells. At the GM's discretion, such as after reaching certain milestones or completing Magic Courier quests, the saddlebag may offer the following additional spells that can be cast from it: blink (3 charges), dimension door (4 charges), divination (4 charges), etherealness (7 charges), fly (3 charges), magnificent mansion (7 charges), plane shift (7 charges), or secret chest (4 charges). Sentience. The saddlebag is a sentient chaotic neutral bag with an Intelligence of 13, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet.The bag can speak, read, and understand Common. When in the presence of only creatures it trusts, the bag's beak moves when it speaks. Otherwise, the bag communicates telepathically with its wearer. The bag can speak and communicate with griffons. Personality. The bag's purpose is to carry, collect, and deliver magic items. Different bags have different personalities, but they are for the most part largely pleasant to talk to. Their voices are bird-like and are filled with occasional coos and squawks, and their stitched eyes widen, squint, and move expressively.If the bag's wearer or allies fail to fulfill Magic Courier quests, it may stop offering its magic to them. If it does, their items may be lost or inaccessible within the bag, or potentially spat out. While the bag provides the names of item recipients and delivery locations, it doesn't know any more information than what was provided to it by the astral griffon. Regardless, it does its best to help its wearer and allies find the specified person or location on the letter. Destroying the Griffon's Saddlebag. While there is no way to permanently destroy the saddlebag, piercing it with an artifact returns it to its place of origin for repair before it's returned to the multiverse in a new location. Placing a Griffon's Saddlebag inside the extradimensional space created by another Griffon's Saddlebag returns both items to their place of origin and sends all the items stored within them to the griffon's forge on the Astral Plane."
"The Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad","IMR","96","artifact","wondrous item","requires attunement","","","","","","This strange device was once thought to have been built by gods long forgotten and to have survived the eons since their passing, for it is incredibly ancient and crafted by means unlike anything known today. However, its true origins derive from a planar craft that crashed in the Barrier Peaks, for the Infernal Machine once functioned as this craft's central command console.Explorers who discovered the crash site removed the command console and brought it back to civilization, not understanding its true purpose or powers. In later years, the console came into the possession of Baron Lum. By experimenting with its many controls, he was able to achieve astounding and destructive magical effects in the building of his empire, and so the artifact came to be known as the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad. Yet with Lum's eventual defeat, his great machine was destroyed.The Infernal Machine is a delicate, intricate, bulky, and heavy device, weighing some 5,500 pounds. It can be operated using a control panel containing sixty levers, forty dials, twenty switches, and a number of jeweled components. These controls generate all kinds of powers and effects, as noted below. Silver Wire. The Infernal Machine's great size makes it largely immobile. To make ongoing use of the machine (such as while adventuring), it can be connected to its attuned user by a silver wire, a supply of which can always be produced from the machine's inner workings. This silver wire shares the same general nature as the silvery cord of an astral projection spell, connecting to the body of the user and trailing behind them. When so attached, the wire becomes invisible, astral, and extends to virtually infinite length.As long as the wire remains intact, the attuned user can make full use of the Infernal Machine's powers, with their effects centered around the user. If the wire is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it can cut an astral projection's silvery cord—the user suffers a sudden burst of feedback from the machine that kills them instantly.Any effect of the Infernal Machine that requires concentration can be concentrated on by a remote user. The Infernal Machine's effects have a spell save DC of 14 or the attuned user's spell save DC, whichever is higher. Summon Monster. When first used by Baron Lum, the Infernal Machine was known for its ability to unleash terrible monsters within the world. Specific combinations of its controls can still recreate the effects of various spells of the conjuration school, as follows:1/day: conjure animals, summon lesser demons1/7 days: conjure minor elementals, conjure woodland beings, summon greater demon1/month: conjure elemental, conjure fey Wish. The Infernal Machine has the ability to bend the nature of reality, with the proper combination of controls recreating the effect of a wish spell (including all side effects). Due to the complex nature of its programming, this feature can be used only once per month. Each time this effect is used, there is a cumulative 10 percent chance of the Infernal Machine malfunctioning, necessitating seven days' worth of repairs and reprogramming, as well as the expenditure of 500 gp in parts, before it can be used again. When these repairs are done, the cumulative chance of malfunction returns to 10 percent. Random Properties. There are far more possible combinations for the Infernal Machine's controls than can ever be known or matrixed—especially as the controls shift position and reset themselves over time. At the end of each long rest of the user attuned to it, the Infernal Machine generates 1d4 + 1 random beneficial properties and 1d4 + 1 detrimental properties. Roll for each of these properties on the Infernal Machine Properties table. To keep things interesting, the DM might roll secretly for detrimental properties, revealing those properties only during the course of play.Once set, these properties last until the end of the attuned user's next long rest.(Our thanks to the D&D community for their suggestions for the properties of the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad!) Destroying the Machine. The Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad is self-repairing of anything short of catastrophic damage, and how it was disabled in Lum's time remains a mystery. It is rumored that if one specific combination of controls is set, the Infernal Machine will enter a repair mode, allowing unfettered access to its inner workings—and preventing it from restoring itself if it is attacked. Alternatively, other combinations of controls might cause the Infernal Machine to teleport its most critical components to some hiding place deep in space and time, rendering it inoperable until those components are found again.Infernal Machine Propertiesd100Beneficial PropertyDetrimental Property01You have a flying speed of 150 feet but lose all other movement.You are blinded.02You can cast the speak with animals spell at will, but can use it to speak with only one animal of your choice.All animals despise you.

"Torrdok's Magnificent Forgery","TGS2","177","rare","wondrous item","","","","","","","This large, gilded mirror is 5 feet tall, 3 feet across, and weighs 20 pounds. While the mirror is against a wall or similar vertical surface, you can speak its first command word using an action to magically fasten the mirror to the wall. You can unfasten the mirror by speaking the command word again using another action.While the mirror is fastened to a wall, its reflective surface becomes oily and moves ever so slightly. If the fastened mirror is facing a room that's no larger than 40 feet on a side for 24 hours, the reflection stiffens and becomes a beautiful painting of the room's reflection. The painting remains until the mirror is removed from the wall. While the painting remains, a creature can use an action to touch its surface and speak the mirror's second command word to be magically transported to a special demiplane identical to the room the mirror is facing, including any of its furniture and decorations. Doing so again from within the demiplane transports you back to the nearest unoccupied space to the mirror in the original room. Any furniture or decoration created by the demiplane can't be removed from it, and if a piece of furniture or decoration was magical in the original room, the copy of it is not. Further, any doors or windows found in the original room don't appear in the demiplane's version.Anything brought into the demiplane is shunted back to the original room when the mirror is removed from the wall. While the painting remains, it is indistinguishable from a regular painting.

When you do, the weapon becomes magical while you hold it in that hand. The weapon ceases to be magical if you throw, drop, or stow it. While the weapon is magical in this way, it's wreathed in dark flames that cause any target hit by it to take necrotic damage, instead of the weapon's normal damage, as well as an extra 1d8 fire damage.While unworn, the gauntlet can be magically altered to fit over either hand by speaking its other command word as an action. Curse. This gauntlet is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you.

When it does, the target and up to 2 other targets of your choice that you can see within 15 feet of it must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage, and if it is Large or smaller, it's pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, a target takes half as much bludgeoning damage and isn't pushed. This bludgeoning damage is doubled against objects and structures. Range. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range. Ammunition. You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way. Heavy. Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively. Loading.

"Tremor Spike","TGS2","178","rare","rod","","","","","15 lb.","","This industrial, hollow rod is 3 feet long and weighs 15 pounds. The rod has a tapered spike on one end and an open, tower-like chimney on the other. Three hinged legs unfold from the sides of the rod, allowing it to stand upright with its spiked end pointed downward. Standing or collapsing the rod in this way requires an action.The unfolded legs magically fasten the rod to the ground while it's standing, but a creature can use its action to try to push it over with a successful DC 20 Strength check. Once the rod is no longer standing, it magically deactivates and collapses itself again.As a bonus action, you can press a button on the standing rod to cause its mechanisms to churn and whir, repeatedly sending its spike into the ground below it. Pressing the button again deactivates the rod. The spike sends out loud, drum-like shockwaves every 6 seconds. The waves are audible out to 300 feet, or 1200 feet if a creature has tremorsense. If a creature has tremorsense, its range is halved while it's within 300 feet of the active rod. A creature can't perceive anything within 30 feet of the active rod using its tremorsense, but is aware that the disrupting shockwaves originate from that location."

Due to his control over ice, Levistus can conjure the True-Ice Shards from anywhere, including if they were destroyed.You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the magical rapier and it does 1d8 cold damage instead of its regular damage. When using the magic dagger, you gain a +3 bonus to your AC, as long as it is used as your offhand weapon, and it does 1d6 cold damage instead of its regular damage.Because Levistus conjures the True-Ice Shards at will, he often rewards a copy of the artifact to his most loyal followers. The copies are identical to the original with one exception: Levistus can destroy or retrieve a copy at any time. Random Properties. The True-Ice Shards have the following random properties:2 major beneficial properties2 minor detrimental properties1 major detrimental property Sub-Zero. Cold damage dealt with the shards ignores resistances and immunities. Creatures vulnerable to cold damage take triple damage from the True-Ice Shards, rather than double.After you damage a creature with the shards, you may use a bonus action to force the creature to make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature that took the damage becomes vulnerable to cold damage for 24 hours. Once you use this feature, you may not use it again until after you have finished a long rest. The Best Defense. As a reaction to being attacked, you use the rapier to increase your defense, adding +3 to your AC until the end of your next turn. If you attack with the rapier before the end of your next turn, you do not have its +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls. Mental Command. While attuned to the True-Ice Shards, you can use an action to cast the Detect Thoughts spell (save DC 20), targeting any creature you have previously met. If the targeted creature is on a different plane of existence, the spell fails.As long as you maintain concentration, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to the focused creature. It can reply—using a bonus action to do so—as long as the focus and concentration continue. Omniscient. You can use the True-Ice Shards to cast a variety of divination spells. Locate Animals or Plants, Locate Creature, and Locate Object may be cast at will, and don't have a maximum range. Other limitations of the spells still apply, and they can't detect subjects on other planes of existence.Additionally, you may cast Scrying (with a spell save DC of 20) and Find the Path. Once either spell is cast, you must finish a long rest before casting either of them again. Destroying the Shards. While Levistus still lives, destroying the True-Ice Shards serves little purpose, as he is capable of recreating them at will. That aside, the shards can be destroyed when subjected to a sufficient source of heat.

The True-Ice Shards have the following random properties:2 major beneficial properties2 minor detrimental properties1 major detrimental property Sub-Zero.

Once either spell is cast, you must finish a long rest before casting either of them again. Destroying the Shards. While Levistus still lives, destroying the True-Ice Shards serves little purpose, as he is capable of recreating them at will. That aside, the shards can be destroyed when subjected to a sufficient source of heat. A few such sources include the inside of an active volcano, a continuous source of Hellfire, or a powerful fire spell cast at 9th level. Finesse.

When it grows restless, Wave has a habit of humming tunes that vary from sea chanteys to sacred hymns of the sea gods.Wave zealously desires to convert mortals to the worship of one or more sea gods, or else to consign the faithless to death. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to further the weapon's objectives in the world. The trident has a nostalgic attachment to the place where it was forged, a desolate island called Thunderforge. A sea god imprisoned a family of storm giants there, and the giants forged Wave in an act of devotion to—or rebellion against—that god.Wave harbors a secret doubt about its own nature and purpose. For all its devotion to the sea gods, Wave fears that it was intended to bring about a particular sea god's demise. This destiny is something Wave might not be able to avert. Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property. Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack."

"Wayfinder Sphere","TGS2","186","rare","wondrous item","","","","","5 lb.","","This spinning metal sphere is 6 inches in diameter and weighs 5 pounds. You can tap the orb twice as an action to activate it. While activated, the orb records basic details about the space that it can see within 100 feet. The orb has darkvision out to 100 feet, but can't see through heavily obscured areas or illusions. Tapping it twice again deactivates the orb.The activated orb can display its recorded maps. If you are within 30 feet of it, you can speak its first command word, followed by a description of a location it's mapped. For example, you can command the orb to recall the entrance to a series of catacombs you explored 2 days ago, or the path you took to get through a twisting labyrinth. When you do, an illusory map appears in a 5-foot sphere centered on the orb that shows basic details about the recorded area, such as buildings, pathways, roads, signs, topography, and trees. While you're within 5 feet of the map, you can use a series of intuitive gestures to change the map's rotation, displayed location, or scale: showing as little of the recorded area as a 25-foot radius, or as much as a 1-mile radius. Speaking the command word again causes the map to vanish.If you are within 30 feet of it, you can speak a second command word as an action to make the orb rise into the air and float no more than 5 feet off the ground. The orb hovers in this way until you or another creature grasps it. If you move more than 30 feet from the hovering orb, it follows you until it is within 30 feet of you. It takes the shortest route to do so. If prevented from moving, the orb sinks gently to the ground and becomes inactive.You can speak a third command word as an action, followed by a location name, while within 30 feet of the floating orb to cause it to move on its own. If the named location has been recorded by the orb and is within 1 mile of you, the sphere moves on its own and floats up to 10 feet ahead of you, guiding you to the named location using any of its recorded maps of the area to guide you. Once you reach your destination or speak the command word again, the orb begins to follow you again."

It is measured in livestock, grain, land, rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources (such as a mine or a forest).Guilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade. Chartered companies are granted rights to conduct trade along certain routes, to send merchant ships to various ports, or to buy or sell specific goods.

"Wyrmskull Throne","SKT","237","artifact","wondrous item","","","","","","","Built by dwarven gods and entrusted to the rulers of Shanatar, an ancient dwarven empire. The Wyrmskull Throne was a symbol of dwarven power and pride for ages untold. The throne hovers a foot off the ground and is a massive thing made of polished obsidian with oversized feet—the impaled skulls of four ancient blue dragons. Runes glisten in the carved obsidian winking to life with blue energy when the throne's powers are activated.After the fall of Shanatar, the Wyrmskull Throne fell into the clutches of less honorable creatures. A band of adventurers wrested the throne from the aquatic elf tyrant Gantar Kraok and sold it to the storm giant Neri for a considerable fortune. Neri had the throne magically enlarged and gave it to her husband, King Hekaton, as a gift, along with one of the Ruling Scepters of Shanatar, which she had found in a wreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea. Only a creature attuned to a Ruling Scepter and in possession of it can harness the powers of the Wyrmskull Throne, which has become the centerpiece of King Hekaton's throne room in the undersea citadel of Maelstrom. Fear of the throne's power has helped prevent evil giants from challenging or threatening Hekaton's leadership.Any creature not attuned to a Ruling Scepter who sits on the throne is paralyzed and encased in a magical force field. While encased, the creature can't be touched or moved from the throne. Touching a Ruling Scepter to the force field dispels the field, though the creature remains paralyzed until it is separated from the throne.Any creature seated on the throne can hear faint Whispers in Draconic—the whisperings of four blue dragons whose skulls adorn the throne. Although powerless, these spirits try to influence the decisions of the throne's master. Properties of the Throne. The throne has 9 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
